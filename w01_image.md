# Work 01: The Amazing Pi Mage

  - 1) The program, when run, takes the image and changes the filter of the image to appear in different colors, while maintaining the same gradient/shade.
  - 2) I think pImage is an array of pixels corresponding to the the image inorder to portray the image
  - 3) pImage is a class
  - 4) art.pixels is probably a component of the class that might give the color of each pixels
  - 5) Image(art) probably sets the image on the coordinates that follow, laying the pixels from the image onto the screen.
  - 6) I think they both change the shade of the image and alter the color pattern equally amonst alll pixels to maintain the shade.
